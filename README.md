# pokego-cert-unpinning
Niantic implemented certificate pininng, which means you can't mitm your game. I don't like that, so I have decided to undo this security feature. 

# If you want to use this app
uninstall the official app first. Then you can either download the app to your android and install it from there, or from a computer run 

adb install modifiedPgo.apk
If you are using PTC, you should be good to go. If you're using google to login, you need to run the script with mitmproxy or mitmdump.
